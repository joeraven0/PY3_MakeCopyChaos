# PY3_MakeCopyChaos
Copy files from one location to another until disk is full. It will all be organized in folders similar to a hell of chaos.

Slow method but will most likely make it more difficult to recover files that were deleted before running this script.
Why not download Hillary Clintons leaked mails and let the script fill the disk with the mails before recycling.

Method: Really slow, but free.
